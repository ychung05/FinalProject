I want to make the timeline of the Nam June Paik (July 20, 1932 â€“ January 29, 2006) who was a Korean American artist. He worked with a variety of media and is considered to be the founder of video art. He did television projects, installations, performances, collaborations but He is very famous for his vedio art. I chose him because I thought his work can be represent well on the web because he enjoyed to use videos and lights in his works. also, he is one of my favorite artists. I am not sure that I can do this or not but I want to try his experiment of media on my website.
